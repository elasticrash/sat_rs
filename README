# Rust Port of MiniSAT2

## Thought Log (2020)

After 8 months and a hell more experience in Rust I decided to revisit this project and fix the remaining bugs. I am really surprices with myself on how much I managed back then with minimal knowledge of the languages

Some simple problems seem to be working fine, more complicated ones give still the wrong results

The results where completely wrong, it turned out I was reading the clauses incorrectly from the cnf files. This is now fixed. But the solver gives incorrects results.

Got my first results, no idea yet if they are correct, there were a lot of wrong assumptions when I had to do bitwise operation on enums. Need time, to write tests.
