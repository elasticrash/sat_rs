Rust Port of MiniSAT2

I am definately taking the wrong approach of porting as much as you can blindly and then try to piece them together but I am having fun and learning rust at the same time.

Got my first results, no idea yet if they are correct, there were a lot of wrong assumptions when I had to do bitwise operation on enums. Need time, to write tests.

The results where completely wrong, it turned out I was reading the clauses incorrectly from the cnf files. This is now fixed. But the solver gives incorrects results.
