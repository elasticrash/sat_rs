The official [MiniSat page](http://minisat.se/MiniSat.html) links to a C# port, but the link is dead.
I've recovered the source code (although not, alas, the tests) with the aid of archive.org, and that forms the first commit.
I intend to make some improvements, because there is room for speed and memory optimisation.
